[01:25:29] [Server thread/ERROR]: #!#! This issue is NOT your fault! You probably can't fix it yourself, either.
[01:25:29] [Server thread/ERROR]: #!#! It looks like you are using some plugin(s) that alter how Skript works (addons).

[01:25:29] [Server thread/ERROR]: #!#! We could not identify which of those are specially related, so this might also be Skript issue.
[01:25:29] [Server thread/ERROR]: #!#! You should try disabling those plugins one by one, trying to find which one causes it.
[01:25:29] [Server thread/ERROR]: #!#! If the error doesn't disappear even after disabling all listed plugins, it is probably Skript issue.
[01:25:29] [Server thread/ERROR]: #!#! In that case, you will be given instruction on how should you report it.
[01:25:29] [Server thread/ERROR]: #!#! On the other hand, if the error disappears when disabling some plugin, report it to author of that plugin.
[01:25:29] [Server thread/ERROR]: #!#! Only if the author tells you to do so, report it to Skript's issue tracker.
